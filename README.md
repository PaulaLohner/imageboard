# Imageboard

This single page application was built to work similarly to apps such as Instagram. A site where anybody could go and post an image of their choosing, along with a title and a textual description of that image, and others could go and look at that image and make thoughtful remarks about it. <br>
It was the first time I've worked with the Vue.js framework and the app resources include image uploading through AWS S3 and a SQL database, dynamic routing and infinite scrolling. <br>
